In this project, we were required to develop a game that worked on 4G/5G mobile networks.
We utilized a mobile base station and mobile packet core, and configured SIM cards for the base station.

We built a word guessing game (inspired by Wordle):
- Randomly generated 5-letter English word everyday
- Users have 5 guesses a day

The game was built in Python 3.7 using Flask
- hosted on a mobile server
- can be accessed through the browser of a phone connected to the 4G network.
- can be connected to and played by multiple devices at the same time.

Agile/Scrum methodology was used in this project, with Beatriz Glaser as the Scrum Master.
